## Problem Statement

Our application experiences frequent **"database is locked"** errors preventing normal operations and causing downtime. These errors occur when multiple connections attempt to write to the SQLite database simultaneously, uncommitted transactions remain open, or applications crash while holding locks.

### Business Impact

- Application downtime during lock events

- Poor user experience with failed operations

- Potential data inconsistency

- Increased support burden

## Solution Overview

Implement comprehensive database stability improvements based on SQLite best practices to eliminate lock-related errors.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Transaction Management (Critical Priority)

Implement proper transaction patterns with explicit BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT TRANSACTION, and ROLLBACK TRANSACTION statements.

**Implementation:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO analytics_table VALUES (...);
COMMIT TRANSACTION;

```

- Ensure all operations use explicit transactions

- Add proper error handling with rollback capabilities

- Implement transaction timeouts

### 2. Connection Management (High Priority)

Configure busy_timeout pragma to automatically handle connection conflicts:

```sql
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000; -- 5 second timeout

```

**Requirements:**

- Set appropriate timeout values (5-10 seconds recommended)

- Implement connection pooling to limit concurrent connections

- Add connection cleanup logic to prevent orphaned connections

### 3. Isolation Level Optimization (Medium Priority)

Configure appropriate isolation levels, with SERIALIZABLE isolation queuing transactions to execute serially, preventing simultaneous database access.

**Implementation:**

- Evaluate current isolation level usage

- Use SERIALIZABLE for critical operations

- Apply READ UNCOMMITTED for read-heavy operations where appropriate

### 4. Error Handling & Monitoring (High Priority)

- Comprehensive error handling for lock scenarios

- Retry logic with exponential backoff

- Monitoring and alerting for lock frequency

- Detailed error logging for debugging

### 5. File System Considerations (Low Priority)

Ensure proper file permissions and handle potential file system issues, with recommended permissions of 664 for the database file.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Weeks 1-2)

1. Implement proper transaction management

1. Add busy_timeout configuration

1. Deploy connection cleanup logic

### Phase 2: Enhanced Stability (Weeks 3-4)

1. Implement retry logic and error handling

1. Add monitoring and alerting

1. Optimize isolation levels

### Phase 3: Long-term Improvements (Weeks 5-6)

1. Connection pooling implementation

1. Performance optimization

1. Documentation updates

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: Reduce database lock errors by 95%

- **Secondary**: Improve average response time by 20%

- **Monitoring**: Zero unhandled database lock exceptions

- **Reliability**: 99.9% database operation success rate

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: Low - Changes are primarily configuration and error handling improvements

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Implement changes incrementally

- Maintain backward compatibility

- Add comprehensive testing

- Monitor metrics closely during rollout

## Dependencies

- Database team for configuration changes

- DevOps team for monitoring setup

- QA team for testing database scenarios

## Timeline

**Target Completion**: 6 weeks

**Critical Path**: Transaction management and timeout configuration
