# Application Infrastructure

## Overview

The GKL League Analytics application consists of a multi-tier architecture with separated frontend, backend API, and data processing layers. The system is deployed on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure for global performance and reliability.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer (`web-ui/frontend/`)

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18.x for component-based UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Context API for state management

**Key Components:**

#### Pages
- **Home**: Dashboard with league overview
- **Transaction Explorer**: Browse and filter all transactions
- **Player Explorer**: Search and analyze players
- **Player Spotlight**: Detailed player usage analytics
- **Daily Lineups**: View historical lineup decisions
- **Analytics**: Advanced statistical analysis
- **Managers**: Team-specific insights

#### Component Architecture
```

├── pages/              # Route-level components
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/        # Shared components
│   ├── lineups/       # Lineup-specific components
│   ├── player-spotlight/ # Player analysis components
│   └── transactions/  # Transaction components
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
├── services/          # API communication layer
└── utils/             # Utility functions
```

#### State Management
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Custom hooks for data fetching

- Session storage for user preferences

### 2. API Layer (`cloudflare-production/src/`)

**Infrastructure:**
- Cloudflare Workers for edge computing
- D1 Database for data storage
- KV Storage for caching
- Durable Objects for state management (future)

**API Architecture:**

#### Route Structure
```
/api/
├── /players           # Player listings and search
├── /players/:id       # Individual player data
├── /players/:id/spotlight # Player usage analysis
├── /transactions      # Transaction history
├── /lineups          # Daily lineup data
├── /analytics        # Statistical endpoints
└── /teams            # Team-specific data
```

#### Request Processing Pipeline
1. **CORS Handling**: Cross-origin request validation
2. **Route Matching**: Pattern-based route resolution
3. **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
4. **Database Query**: Optimized SQL execution
5. **Response Caching**: KV-based response caching
6. **Error Handling**: Structured error responses

#### Worker Configuration
```javascript
// Environment bindings
- DB: D1 database connection
- CACHE: KV namespace for caching
- ENVIRONMENT: production/development flag
```

### 3. Backend Services (`web-ui/backend/`)

**Node.js Backend Services:**

#### Service Layer Architecture
```
services/
├── database.js           # Database connection management
├── lineupService.js      # Lineup business logic
├── playerService.js      # Player data operations
├── playerSpotlightService.js # Advanced player analytics
├── playerStatsService.js # Statistical calculations
└── transactionService.js # Transaction processing
```

#### Key Features
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Query Optimization**: Prepared statements and indexing

- **Caching Strategy**: In-memory and Redis caching (future)

### 4. Data Access Layer

#### Database Abstraction
- Repository pattern for data access
- Query builders for complex operations
- Transaction support for data integrity
- Migration system for schema updates

#### Data Models
```
Core Entities:
