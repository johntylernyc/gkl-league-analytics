# Root Files Organization Summary
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Task**: Organize 6 root-level files into appropriate directories

## Problem
There were 6 files in the root of `docs/development-docs/` that should have been organized into appropriate subdirectories for better structure and findability.

## Files Moved

### 1. Process Documentation → Meta Folder
**Created**: `meta/` directory for process and methodology documentation
- `file-rename-mapping.md` → `meta/file-rename-mapping.md`
  - **Reason**: Internal process documentation about the file renaming methodology

### 2. User Guides → Guides Folder  
- `guide-local-development-setup.md` → `guides/guide-local-development-setup.md`
  - **Reason**: Setup guide belongs with other user guides

### 3. Completed Work → Implemented Folder
- `report-filename-content-accuracy-review-2025-08-05.md` → `implemented/`
  - **Reason**: Report of completed work reviewing filename accuracy
  
- `review-documentation-2025-08-05.md` → `implemented/`
  - **Reason**: Summary of completed documentation review work
  
- `summary-codebase-reorganization-2025.md` → `implemented/`
  - **Reason**: Summary of completed codebase reorganization work
  
- `summary-documentation-renaming-2025-08-05.md` → `implemented/`
  - **Reason**: Summary of completed documentation renaming work

## Additional Cleanup
Fixed one remaining file that didn't follow naming convention:
- `player-stats-pipeline-improvements-implementation-plan.md` → `plan-player-stats-pipeline-improvements-2025-08.md`

## New Directory Structure

```
docs/development-docs/
├── architecture/           # System architecture documents
├── deployment/            # Deployment-specific documentation  
├── guides/               # User guides and how-to documents
├── implemented/          # Completed work reports and summaries
├── in-progress/          # Active development plans
├── meta/                 # Process and methodology documentation
└── planned/              # Future planning documents
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clean Root**: No files in root directory - everything properly categorized
2. **Logical Grouping**: Related documents grouped together
3. **Easy Discovery**: Developers can find documents by category
4. **Process Documentation**: Meta folder for internal process docs
5. **Consistent Organization**: All directories follow clear purposes

## File Count by Directory

- **architecture/**: 5 files
- **deployment/**: 6 files  
- **guides/**: 12 files
- **implemented/**: 23 files
- **in-progress/**: 3 files
- **meta/**: 2 files (including this summary)
- **planned/**: 4 files

**Total**: 55 organized files with clear categorization

## Validation

✅ **No root files remaining**  
✅ **All files in appropriate categories**  
✅ **Naming convention followed consistently**  
✅ **Logical directory structure maintained**

The development documentation is now fully organized with a clean, professional structure that makes it easy for developers to navigate and find relevant documentation.
