# Release Notes Restructure Summary
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Task**: Restructure release notes organization and improve documentation standards

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Release Notes Location
**From**: `docs/permanent-docs/release-notes/`  
**To**: `docs/release-notes/`

**Reasoning**: 
- Release notes are user-facing content, not internal technical documentation
- Better separation between user documentation and technical documentation
- Easier to find and access for users and stakeholders
- Consistent with industry standards (many projects have release notes at docs root)

### 2. Enhanced Release Notes Standards

#### Created Template
- **New File**: `docs/release-notes/TEMPLATE.md`
- **Purpose**: Standardized format for all release notes
- **Structure**: User-friendly format with clear sections

#### Required Documentation Links
All release notes must now include:
- **Product Requirements**: Link to related PRD
- **Technical Implementation**: Link to implementation plan
- **Benefits**: Better traceability from user-facing features to technical documentation

### 3. Updated Existing Release Note
- **File**: `docs/release-notes/2025-08-05-transaction-timestamps.md`
- **Added**: Links to PRD and implementation plan
- **Result**: Now follows new standard format

### 4. Updated Process Documentation

#### CLAUDE.md Updates
- Updated release notes path: `docs/release-notes/`
- Added requirement for PRD and implementation plan links
- Added reference to template usage

#### Deployment Standards Updates
- Updated release notes location in deployment standards
- Added required documentation links section
- Added template reference requirement

### 5. Verified Reference Updates
- ✅ All references to old path updated
- ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with new requirements
- ✅ Deployment standards updated
- ✅ No broken links remaining

## New Release Notes Structure

```
docs/
├── release-notes/
│   ├── TEMPLATE.md                          # Template for new releases
│   └── 2025-08-05-transaction-timestamps.md # Example following new format
├── prds/                                    # Referenced from release notes
└── development-docs/
    └── implemented/                         # Referenced from release notes
```

## Template Structure

Each release note now includes:

1. **Header**: Release date, version, impact level
2. **What's New**: User-friendly feature description
3. **Before vs After**: Clear comparison
4. **Where You'll See This**: Specific UI locations
5. **Key Benefits**: User value proposition
6. **Technical Details**: Brief technical summary
7. **What's Next**: Future enhancements (optional)
8. **Related Documentation**: **NEW** - Links to PRD and implementation plan

## Benefits Achieved

### For Users
- **Easier Access**: Release notes at docs root level
- **Better Context**: Links to background requirements and technical details
- **Consistent Format**: All releases follow same template

### For Developers
- **Clear Standards**: Template provides consistent structure
- **Traceability**: Easy to trace from feature to requirements to implementation
- **Process Integration**: Release notes creation integrated into deployment process

### for Project Management
- **Complete Documentation**: Every release links back to requirements and implementation
- **Audit Trail**: Clear lineage from idea (PRD) → implementation → release
- **Stakeholder Communication**: User-friendly format with technical details available

## Process Integration

Release notes creation is now integrated into:

1. **CLAUDE.md**: Development standards and requirements
2. **Deployment Standards**: Mandatory pre-deployment checklist item
3. **Template Usage**: Consistent format enforcement

## Validation

✅ **Location Updated**: Release notes moved to appropriate location  
✅ **Standards Enhanced**: Required links and template created  
✅ **Documentation Updated**: All process docs reflect changes  
✅ **References Fixed**: No broken links or outdated paths  
✅ **Template Applied**: Existing release note updated to new format

The release notes system now provides better organization, clearer standards, and improved traceability between user-facing features and their technical documentation.
