# Documentation Reorganization Summary
**Date: August 4, 2025**

## Overview
All project documentation has been reorganized from scattered locations throughout the project into a centralized, well-structured `/docs` directory organized by implementation status and category.

## What Changed

### Documentation Structure Created
```
docs/
├── README.md              # Documentation index and guide
├── prds/                  # Product Requirements Documents (unchanged)
├── implemented/           # Completed features (35 files)
├── in-progress/           # Active development (2 files)
├── planned/               # Future work (4 files)
├── guides/                # How-to guides (12 files)
├── architecture/          # System design (4 files)
└── deployment/            # Deployment docs (6 files)
```

### Files Kept in Original Locations
These files remain in their original locations as they serve active purposes:

1. **Root Directory** (Active project files):
   - `README.md` - Main project documentation
   - `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions
   - `TODO.md` - Central task tracking

2. **Module READMEs** (Module-specific documentation):
   - `daily_lineups/README.md`
   - `player_stats/README.md`
   - `web-ui/README.md`
   - `cloudflare/README.md`

### Files Moved by Category

#### ✅ Implemented (Successfully completed work)
- Deployment summaries and completion reports
- Fixed issues (HOME_PAGE_FIX, PLAYERS_PAGE_FIX, etc.)
- Daily lineups completion stages (stage1-3)
- Test results
- GitHub Actions fixes

#### 🚧 In-Progress (Active development)
- `implementation_plan.md` - Daily lineups ongoing work
- `INCREMENTAL_UPDATES.md` - Transaction update system

#### 📋 Planned (Future development)
- `IMMEDIATE_NEXT_STEPS.md` - Priority items
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - Long-term roadmap
- `SCHEDULE_REFERENCE.md` - Scheduling plans
- `URGENT_SECURITY_FIX.md` - Security improvements

#### 📚 Guides (How-to documentation)
- Security setup guides
- Deployment quickstart guides
- Configuration templates
- Authentication documentation
- Feature-specific guides

#### 🏗️ Architecture (Technical design)
- Database architecture plans
- System separation strategies
- Integration architectures
- Implementation designs

#### 🚀 Deployment (Deployment processes)
- Deployment checklists
- Testing procedures
- Integration documentation
- Status tracking

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear Organization**: Documents are now organized by status and purpose
2. **Easy Navigation**: Clear directory names indicate content type
3. **Status Visibility**: Easy to see what's done, in-progress, and planned
4. **Central Index**: `/docs/README.md` provides a comprehensive guide
5. **Maintained Context**: Module READMEs stay with their code
6. **Active Files Accessible**: Key project files remain at root level

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **New Documentation**: Place in appropriate category based on status
2. **Status Changes**: Move documents between directories as status changes
3. **Module Docs**: Keep module-specific docs with the module
4. **PRDs**: Product requirements remain in `/docs/prds/`
5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and reorganize as needed

## Statistics

- **Total MD files organized**: 51
- **Files moved to /docs**: 43
- **Files kept in place**: 8 (active project files and module READMEs)
- **Categories created**: 6 (+ PRDs)
- **Cleanup completed**: August 4, 2025
