# Stage 1 Completion Report: Database Schema & Infrastructure

## Overview
Stage 1 of the Daily Lineups module implementation has been successfully completed. All database infrastructure and core schema components are now in place and tested.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Database Tables Created
- **daily_lineups**: Main production table for lineup data
- **daily_lineups_test**: Test environment table
- **lineup_positions**: Position lookup table with 15 positions
- **player_usage_summary**: Aggregated usage statistics
- **team_lineup_patterns**: Team pattern tracking
- **daily_game_info**: Game information tracking (added via migration)

### ✅ 2. Performance Indexes Implemented
Created 17 performance indexes including:
- Single column indexes for date, team, player queries
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Separate indexes for test tables
- MLB team indexes (added via migration)

### ✅ 3. Database Views Created
- **v_current_lineups**: Current season lineups with position names
- **v_player_frequency**: Player start/bench frequency analysis
- **v_team_daily_summary**: Team roster summary by date

### ✅ 4. Migration System Established
- Created migration tracking table
- Implemented versioned migration system
- Current schema version: 1.0.2
- Includes rollback capability planning

### ✅ 5. Test/Production Separation
- Separate tables for test and production environments
- Environment-based table selection in config
- Isolated test data from production data

### ✅ 6. Schema Testing Completed
All tests passed including:
- Data insertion and retrieval
- Index performance (<1ms for complex queries)
- UNIQUE constraint enforcement
- View functionality
- Trigger operations
- Position lookup data

## Scripts Created

1. **apply_schema.py**: Applies initial schema to database
2. **migrate_lineups.py**: Manages schema migrations and versioning
3. **test_schema.py**: Comprehensive schema testing suite

## Performance Metrics

- **Query Performance**: Complex queries execute in <1ms
- **Index Coverage**: All primary access patterns indexed
- **Data Integrity**: UNIQUE constraints prevent duplicates
- **Schema Version**: 1.0.2 with migration tracking

## Database Structure Summary

```sql
Tables: 8 (including migration tracking)
Indexes: 19 (including auto-created)
Views: 3
Triggers: 2
Total Positions: 15
```

## Next Steps (Stage 2)

According to the implementation plan, Stage 2 will focus on:
1. Creating `DailyLineupsCollector` class
2. Implementing token management integration
3. Adding XML parsing for roster responses
4. Implementing retry logic and error handling
5. Adding rate limiting (2-second delays)

## Migration History

| Version | Status    | Description                             |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| 1.0.0   | completed | Initial Daily Lineups schema          |
| 1.0.1   | completed | Add player_team column for MLB tracking |
| 1.0.2   | completed | Add game_info tracking for matchups   |

## Validation Results

- ✅ All tables created successfully
- ✅ Indexes optimize query performance
- ✅ Views provide convenient data access
- ✅ Constraints ensure data integrity
- ✅ Test data validates all functionality

## Commands for Verification

```bash
# Check migration status
python daily_lineups/scripts/migrate_lineups.py status

# Run schema tests
python daily_lineups/scripts/test_schema.py

# Apply any pending migrations
python daily_lineups/scripts/migrate_lineups.py migrate
```

## Conclusion

Stage 1 has been completed successfully with all objectives met. The database infrastructure is robust, performant, and ready for the data collection implementation in Stage 2.
