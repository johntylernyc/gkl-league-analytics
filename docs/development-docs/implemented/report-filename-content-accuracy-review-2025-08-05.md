# Filename vs Content Accuracy Review
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Purpose**: Verify renamed files accurately reflect their contents

## Review Process

After the initial standardized renaming, conducted a systematic review of file contents to ensure filenames accurately represent the actual content and purpose of each document.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Misclassified Document Types

#### `analysis-database-separation-2025.md` → `guide-database-separation-2025.md`
- **Issue**: File was named as "analysis" but content is a step-by-step guide
- **Content**: Setup instructions for test/production database separation
- **Correct Type**: Guide (how-to instructions)

#### `guide-yahoo-auth-setup.md` → `reference-yahoo-auth-technical.md`
- **Issue**: Named as "setup guide" but content is technical documentation
- **Content**: Technical documentation of OAuth2 system components, file structure, and API details
- **Correct Type**: Reference (technical documentation)

#### `template-github-secrets-setup.md` → `guide-github-secrets-setup.md`
- **Issue**: Named as "template" but content is a setup guide
- **Content**: Step-by-step instructions for adding GitHub secrets
- **Correct Type**: Guide (setup instructions)

### 2. Overly Generic Names

#### `plan-general-implementation.md` → `plan-daily-lineups-implementation.md`
- **Issue**: Name was too generic ("general implementation")
- **Content**: Specific implementation plan for Daily Lineups module
- **Fix**: Made name specific to actual content subject
