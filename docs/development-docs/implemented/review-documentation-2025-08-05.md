# Documentation Review Summary
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Claude Code

## Review Scope

Reviewed both permanent-docs and development-docs directories to ensure accuracy and completeness, excluding ongoing work on transaction timestamps and player stats workflow (as requested).

## Actions Taken

### 1. Permanent Documentation Updates

#### Updated Files:
- **permanent-docs/README.md**
  - Fixed API endpoint URL (was placeholder, now correct value)
  - Added references to deployment standards and GitHub Actions D1 integration
  - Updated document status table with current implementation status

- **permanent-docs/data-pipeline-architecture.md**
  - Updated player stats section to reflect August 2025 improvements
  - Added details about consolidated scripts (backfill_stats.py, update_stats.py)
  - Documented D1 integration and data quality validation
  - Added information about archived one-time scripts

### 2. Development Documentation Organization

#### Moved to Implemented:
- `player-stats-pipeline-improvements-implementation-plan.md` (completed August 5, 2025)

#### Already in Implemented:
- `player-spotlight-draft-values-implementation-plan.md` (completed August 5, 2025)

#### Remain in In-Progress:
- `improved-transaction-timestamps-implementation-plan.md` (developer actively working on this)
- `stage2-frontend-completion-summary.md` (related to timestamp feature)

## Current Documentation State

### Permanent Documentation
All permanent documentation is now up to date and accurately reflects the current system architecture, including:
- Deployment standards and procedures
- Data pipeline architecture with recent improvements
- System infrastructure documentation
- Post-mortem from today's production incident

### Development Documentation
- Completed work properly archived in implemented folder
- In-progress work clearly identified
- Good separation between completed and ongoing features

### Post-Mortems
- Production outage incident fully documented with lessons learned
- Deployment standards created and integrated into multiple documents

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly documentation reviews to maintain accuracy
2. **Automation**: Consider automated checks for documentation updates during deployments
3. **Templates**: Create templates for new PRDs and implementation plans
4. **Archive Policy**: Establish clear policies for when to archive development docs

## Notes

The documentation structure is well-organized with clear separation between:
- Permanent reference documentation
- Active development plans
- Completed implementation records
- Post-incident analysis

All critical production issues from today have been properly documented with clear action items implemented in deployment procedures.
