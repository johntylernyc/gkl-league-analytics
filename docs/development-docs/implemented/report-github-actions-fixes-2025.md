# GitHub Actions Issue Fixed âœ…

## Problem
The workflow failed because it was using deprecated GitHub Actions:
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` (deprecated)
- `actions/cache@v3` (outdated)
- `actions/setup-python@v4` (outdated)

## Solution Applied
Updated all GitHub Actions to latest versions:
- âœ… `actions/upload-artifact@v4` (current)
- âœ… `actions/cache@v4` (current)  
- âœ… `actions/setup-python@v5` (current)
- âœ… `actions/checkout@v4` (already current)

## Changes Made
- Updated workflow file: `.github/workflows/data-refresh.yml`
- Committed and pushed fixes to GitHub
- All action versions are now current and supported

## Ready to Test Again

Go back to GitHub Actions and run the workflow again:

1. **GitHub Repository** â†’ **Actions Tab**
2. **"Scheduled Data Refresh"** workflow
3. **"Run workflow"** button
4. Select same options:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Type: `manual`
   - Environment: `test`
   - Date range: `2025-08-01,2025-08-04`

## Expected Results Now
âœ… All jobs should complete successfully without artifact upload errors
âœ… Logs will be uploaded as artifacts (optional - for debugging)
âœ… The data refresh operations will run and complete

## If It Still Fails
Check the new error messages - they should be different now (related to actual functionality, not GitHub Actions deprecation).

Common issues might be:
- Authentication (check YAHOO_REFRESH_TOKEN secret)
- Database tables not existing (expected in GitHub environment)
- Python dependencies missing

## Next Steps After Success
Once the test passes:
- Monitor automatic scheduled runs (6 AM, 1 PM, 10 PM ET)
- Optional: Set up CloudFlare Worker for redundancy
- Optional: Configure notifications

The GitHub Actions infrastructure issue is now resolved! ðŸš€
