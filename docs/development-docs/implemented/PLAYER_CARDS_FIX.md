# ✅ Player Cards Data Fixed!

## Issue
Player cards on the /players page were showing player names but missing all statistical data (transactions, days rostered, times added/dropped, team info, etc.).

## Root Cause
The player search API endpoint was only returning basic player information (name, team, position) but not the additional statistics required by the player cards UI.

## Fix Applied

### Enhanced Player Search Query
Updated the `/player-search/search` endpoint to include:

1. **Transaction Statistics**:
   - `transaction_count` - Total number of transactions involving the player
   - `times_added` - Number of times the player was added
   - `times_dropped` - Number of times the player was dropped

2. **Roster Information**:
   - `days_rostered` - Total days the player has been on a roster
   - `most_recent_team` - The fantasy team that most recently rostered the player
   - `roster_status` - Current roster status (Rostered/Free Agent)

3. **Player Details**:
   - `mlb_team` - Player's MLB team
   - `position` - Eligible positions
   - `health_status` - Injury status (healthy, IL60, etc.)
   - `last_seen` - Last date the player appeared in lineups

## SQL Query Enhancement
The API now uses a comprehensive query with:
- CTE for player summary from daily_lineups
- JOIN with transaction statistics
- LEFT JOIN to include players with no transactions
- Proper aggregation for all statistics

## Verification

### API Response Now Includes:
```json
{
  "player_id": "10794",
  "player_name": "A.J. Minter",
  "mlb_team": "NYM",
  "most_recent_team": "The ShapeShifters",
  "position": "RP,P,IL",
  "health_status": "IL60",
  "days_rostered": 30,
  "last_seen": "2025-04-27",
  "transaction_count": 3,
  "times_added": 1,
  "times_dropped": 2,
  "roster_status": "Rostered"
}
```

- ✅ Player name and MLB team
