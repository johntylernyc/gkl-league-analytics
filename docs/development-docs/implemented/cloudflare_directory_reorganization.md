# Cloudflare Directory Reorganization - August 4, 2025

## Summary
Renamed all Cloudflare-related directories with clear, descriptive names that indicate their specific purposes.

## Changes Made

### Directory Renames
1. **`cloudflare/` → `cloudflare-scheduled-worker/`**
   - Purpose: Scheduled task worker that triggers GitHub Actions at specific times
   - Contains: worker.js for cron-like scheduling (6 AM, 1 PM, 10 PM ET)
   - Not the main application, just a scheduler

2. **`cloudflare-deployment/` → `cloudflare-production/`**
   - Purpose: Production application deployment (API + Frontend)
   - Contains: 
     - API worker code (serves data)
     - Compiled React frontend
     - Database migration scripts
     - D1 database chunks
   - This is what users interact with at goldenknightlounge.com

3. **`deployment/` → `cloudflare-deployment-tools/`**
   - Purpose: Deployment helper scripts and verification tools
   - Contains:
     - verify_deployment.py - Health checks
     - commit_deployment_files scripts
     - Other deployment utilities

## Files Updated
- `scripts/export_to_cloudflare.py` - Updated paths to cloudflare-production
- `cloudflare-deployment-tools/verify_deployment.py` - Updated documentation references
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated directory structure documentation

## Benefits
1. **Clear Purpose**: Each directory name now clearly indicates its function
2. **Consistent Naming**: All Cloudflare-related directories share the `cloudflare-` prefix
3. **No Confusion**: Eliminates confusion between the scheduler and production app
4. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality

## Directory Structure
```
cloudflare-scheduled-worker/    # GitHub Actions trigger (cron replacement)
├── worker.js
├── wrangler.toml
└── README.md

cloudflare-production/          # Main production application
├── src/                        # API worker code
├── static/                     # Frontend assets

└── wrangler.toml

cloudflare-deployment-tools/    # Deployment utilities

```

## Impact
- No functional changes, only naming improvements
- All deployment processes continue to work
- Clearer project structure for future development
