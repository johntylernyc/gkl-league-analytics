# PRD: Release Notes Feature

## Executive Summary

Add a release notes feature to the GKL Fantasy Analytics website that allows users to easily view recent updates, new features, and bug fixes. This will improve user communication and provide transparency about platform improvements.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users have no visibility into:
- Recent platform updates and new features
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Changes that might affect their workflow
- Platform development progress

This creates confusion when features change and users miss important updates that could improve their experience.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: Release notes page receives >10% of unique monthly visitors
- **Secondary**: Reduced user questions about "what changed" or "new features"
- **Adoption**: >50% of returning users click the release notes icon within first 3 visits after feature launch

## User Stories

### Core User Stories
1. **As a regular user**, I want to see a clear indicator when new features are available so I can stay informed about platform improvements
2. **As a returning user**, I want to quickly check what's changed since my last visit so I understand any differences in functionality
3. **As a power user**, I want to see detailed release notes so I can understand technical improvements and how they affect my workflows

### Edge Cases
1. **As a new user**, I want to see recent releases to understand the platform's development velocity
2. **As a mobile user**, I want the release notes to be easily readable on my device

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Must Have
- **Release Notes Icon**: Clear, prominent icon in the website header
- **Release Notes Page**: Dedicated page displaying chronological list of releases
- **Release Entry Format**: Each release should include:
  - Version/date
  - Feature additions
  - Bug fixes
  - Breaking changes (if any)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Navigation**: Easy return to main application from release notes

#### Should Have
- **Visual Indicators**: New release indicator on the icon (badge/dot)
- **Categorization**: Group changes by type (Features, Bug Fixes, Improvements)
- **Recent Releases Focus**: Emphasize last 3-6 releases with full details
- **Search/Filter**: Ability to find specific releases or features

#### Could Have
- **Release Subscription**: Email notifications for major releases
- **Changelog Integration**: Auto-generate from git commits
- **User Feedback**: Comments or reactions on releases

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Release notes page loads in <2 seconds
- Icon doesn't impact header load time
- Mobile-optimized layout

#### Usability
- Icon is immediately recognizable (industry standard)
- Release notes are scannable (headers, bullet points)
- Clear date/version information
- Consistent with existing design system

#### Maintenance
- Easy to add new releases
- Content stored in maintainable format
- No database changes required for updates

## User Experience Design

### Release Notes Icon
- **Location**: Top header, right side near existing navigation
- **Style**: Clean, minimal icon (document with lines or similar)
- **States**: Normal, hover, active
- **Badge**: Small red dot for new releases (optional v2 feature)

### Release Notes Page
- **Layout**: Clean, chronological list with most recent first
- **Entry Format**:
  ```
  ## Version X.X.X - Date
  
  ### 🚀 New Features
  - Feature description
  
  ### 🐛 Bug Fixes

  ### 💡 Improvements
  - Improvement description
  ```

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks release notes icon in header
2. Navigates to `/release-notes` page
3. Can return via browser back or header navigation
4. Page integrates with existing routing

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Approach
- **Frontend Only**: No backend changes required
- **Static Content**: Release notes stored in React components or JSON
- **Existing Stack**: Use current React + Tailwind setup
- **Routing**: Add new route to existing React Router setup

### Data Storage Options
1. **React Component** (Recommended): Embedded in component file
2. **JSON File**: Static JSON imported by component
3. **Markdown Files**: For richer formatting (future enhancement)

### Browser Compatibility
- Support all browsers currently supported by the application
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Accessible markup for screen readers

## Release Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP (Current Sprint)
- Basic release notes icon in header
- Simple release notes page with manual content
- Mobile responsive design
- 3-5 example releases showcasing recent work

### Phase 2: Enhanced (Future)
- Visual indicators for new releases
- Better categorization and filtering
- Auto-generation from git commits
- User engagement features

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Technical Implementation**: Straightforward frontend feature
- **User Adoption**: Industry standard pattern, familiar to users
- **Maintenance**: Simple content updates

### Medium Risk
- **Content Maintenance**: Requires discipline to keep updated
- **Discoverability**: Users need to notice and use the feature

### Mitigation Strategies
- Make icon prominent and recognizable
- Include release notes updates in development workflow
- Start with recent significant releases to demonstrate value
