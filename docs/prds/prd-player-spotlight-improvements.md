# PRD: Player Spotlight Improvements
**Product Requirements Document for Daily Lineups Player Detail Enhancement**

---

## Executive Summary

### Current State
The Daily Lineups feature currently displays player details in a basic modal interface that shows:
- Player name, team, and position type
- Current roster status and health status
- Eligible positions
- Basic usage statistics (total days, games started, benched, IL/NA)
- Recent 10-day activity log

### Target State Vision
Transform the player detail experience into a comprehensive player spotlight page that provides:
- Full-page analytical dashboard
- Season-long performance tracking with percentage breakdowns
- Detailed statistical analysis by roster status
- Monthly timeline visualization with color-coded status indicators
- Comprehensive performance metrics and trends
- Season selector for historical analysis

### Business Value
- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Deeper analytical insights increase time spent in application
- **Improved Decision Making**: Comprehensive data helps users make better lineup and roster decisions
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Advanced player analytics set our platform apart from basic fantasy tools
- **Data Monetization**: Rich analytics create foundation for premium feature offerings
