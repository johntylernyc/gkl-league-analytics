# Player Stats D1 Integration Fix
**Date**: August 12, 2025
**Version**: 2.1.0

## Problem Summary
The player stats data pipeline was failing to write data to Cloudflare D1 production database. All stats jobs were showing as "failed" with no data being stored, despite transactions and lineups working correctly.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Column Name Mismatch**: The `player_mapping` table in D1 had `mlb_id` but `daily_gkl_player_stats` expected `mlb_player_id`
2. **Silent Failures**: Error messages weren't being captured in job logs
3. **Data Type Issues**: NaN values in calculated stats (like batting average) were causing JSON serialization errors
4. **Missing Yahoo IDs**: All player mappings had NULL yahoo_player_id values

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Alignment
- Added `mlb_player_id` column to `player_mapping` table in D1
- Created migration script: `cloudflare-production/sql/fix-player-mapping-column.sql`
- Successfully migrated all 2,779 player mappings

### 2. Code Updates
**File: `data_pipeline/player_stats/comprehensive_collector.py`**
- Fixed column name references to use `mlb_player_id` for D1
- Added NaN handling to replace with NULL for database compatibility
- Enhanced error logging to capture actual D1 failures
- Fixed Yahoo ID conversion logic

### 3. Monitoring Tools Created
- `scripts/monitor_d1_data.py` - Comprehensive data quality monitoring
- `data_pipeline/player_stats/backfill_to_d1.py` - Historical data backfill script

## Current Status

### Data Pipeline Health
| Pipeline | Status | Records | Last Update |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Transactions | ✅ Working | 819 | 2025-08-08 |
| Daily Lineups | ✅ Working | 59,414 | 2025-08-08 |
| Player Stats | ✅ Fixed | 39+ | 2025-08-07 |

### Player Mapping Quality
- Total mappings: 2,779
- With MLB ID: 100%
- With Yahoo ID: 57.2% (1,589 players)

## Next Steps for Full Recovery

### 1. Complete Historical Backfill
Due to D1 API limitations with large batches, run incremental updates:
```bash
# Run day by day for better success rate
python data_pipeline/player_stats/update_stats.py --date 2025-08-08 --use-d1
python data_pipeline/player_stats/update_stats.py --date 2025-08-09 --use-d1
# Continue for each missing date...
```

### 2. Trigger GitHub Actions
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Trigger manual run
gh workflow run data-refresh.yml \
  --field refresh_type=manual \
  --field environment=production

# Monitor status
gh run list --workflow=data-refresh.yml --limit=5
```

### 3. Monitor Data Quality
```bash
# Run monitoring script
python scripts/monitor_d1_data.py

# Check specific date
python data_pipeline/player_stats/data_quality_check.py --date 2025-08-12
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Consistency**: Always ensure column names match between related tables
2. **Error Visibility**: Capture and log actual error messages in job tracking
3. **Data Validation**: Handle edge cases like NaN values before database operations
4. **Incremental Testing**: Test with small batches before bulk operations
5. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring before issues become critical

## Files Modified

1. `cloudflare-production/sql/fix-player-mapping-column.sql` (NEW)
2. `data_pipeline/player_stats/comprehensive_collector.py` (UPDATED)
3. `data_pipeline/player_stats/backfill_to_d1.py` (NEW)
4. `scripts/monitor_d1_data.py` (NEW)
5. `docs/release-notes/2025-08-12-player-stats-d1-fix.md` (NEW)

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Column migration successful (2,779 records updated)
- ✅ Single day stats collection working (39 records for Aug 7)
- ✅ Error logging capturing actual failures
- ✅ NaN handling preventing JSON errors
- ✅ Monitoring script providing visibility

## Known Limitations

1. **Batch Size**: D1 API may timeout with >500 records per request
2. **Yahoo IDs**: 43% of players still missing Yahoo IDs (needs matcher run)
3. **Rate Limits**: PyBaseball API calls may hit rate limits during large backfills

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. The column addition is non-destructive (keeps original `mlb_id`)
2. Code changes are backward compatible
3. Can revert to SQLite-only operation by removing `--use-d1` flag
