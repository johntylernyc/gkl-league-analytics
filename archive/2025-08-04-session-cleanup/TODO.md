## Future Development Stories

### Story 0: Full Season Production Data Collection
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Small

**Background**: With the optimized infrastructure complete, collect full 2025 season transaction data for production analytics.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Complete 2025 season transaction data in production environment
- Comprehensive job logging for all collection runs
- Data validation and quality reporting
- Performance monitoring and optimization

**Tasks**:
1. **Configure full season date range** (2025-03-27 to 2025-09-28)
2. **Execute production data collection** with job logging
3. **Monitor performance and error rates** during collection
4. **Validate data completeness** and quality
5. **Create data summary reports** for analytics readiness

### Story 1: Fantasy League Manager Information System
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

**Background**: Transaction data includes team names from API responses. Adding manager information would enable manager behavior analysis and manager-focused reporting.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Manager information collected from Yahoo Fantasy API
- Job logging implementation following established standards
- Integration with existing simplified team data structure
- Manager analytics capabilities

**Tasks**:
1. **Research Yahoo Fantasy API for manager data**
   - Investigate `/league/{league_key}/teams` endpoint for manager information
   - Document API response structure and available manager fields
   - Test API endpoints with current authentication system

2. **Design manager data collection**
   - Create `league_managers` table with job_id tracking
   - Plan integration with existing job logging infrastructure
   - Design manager-team relationship storage approach

3. **Implement manager collection script**
   - Create script following established job logging pattern
   - Use existing API infrastructure and rate limiting
   - Include comprehensive error handling and status tracking

4. **Integrate with transaction analytics**
   - Link manager data to existing transaction records via team relationships
   - Create manager analytics queries and reports
   - Validate data relationships and quality

### Story 2: Trade Transaction Data Enhancement
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Small

**Background**: Current transaction data may not be fully capturing trade transactions between fantasy teams. Trade data is critical for analyzing manager trading behavior and player value exchanges.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Complete capture of trade transactions showing both sides of trades
- Proper data structure representing multi-player/multi-team trades
- Trade analysis capabilities showing trade partners and trade details

**Tasks**:
1. **Investigate current trade data collection**
   - Review existing transaction data for trade type transactions
   - Analyze trade transaction XML structure in Yahoo API responses
   - Identify gaps in current trade data capture
   - Document trade transaction data model requirements

2. **Enhance trade data parsing**
   - Update transaction parser to handle multi-player trades
   - Implement trade relationship tracking (trade partners)
   - Add trade metadata (trade date, involved teams, etc.)
   - Create trade-specific database schema if needed

3. **Validate trade data completeness**
   - Test trade data collection against known trades
   - Create trade data quality validation
   - Implement trade data consistency checks
   - Document trade data structure and relationships

### Story 3: Data Validation and Quality Assurance Framework
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

**Background**: As data collection expands, robust data validation and quality assurance becomes critical for reliable analytics.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement comprehensive data validation rules
2. Create automated data quality reports
3. Build data consistency checks across related tables
4. Establish data quality monitoring and alerting
5. Create data lineage documentation

### Story 4: Performance Optimization and Scalability
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Large

**Background**: Current system processes data sequentially. As data volume grows and additional leagues are added, performance optimization becomes necessary.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement advanced concurrent processing patterns
2. Add database query optimization and indexing strategy
3. Implement data partitioning for large datasets
4. Create caching layer for frequently accessed data
5. Add monitoring and performance metrics collection

### Story 5: Analytics and Reporting Framework
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: Large

**Background**: Foundation for building analytics and reporting capabilities on top of collected transaction data.

**Tasks**:
1. Design analytics data models and aggregation tables
2. Create transaction analysis functions and stored procedures
3. Build reporting API or interface layer
4. Implement common fantasy baseball analytics (waiver activity, trade analysis, etc.)
5. Create visualization and dashboard capabilities

## Technical Debt

### Code Organization
- Refactor shared utilities into common modules as more data collection scripts are added
- Consider extraction of common database operations into utility functions
- Plan for configuration management as project expands to multiple leagues

### Future Infrastructure
- Evaluate need for data archival strategy for historical seasons  
- Consider migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL for larger datasets
- Plan for distributed processing if multiple leagues are added

### Documentation
- Create comprehensive API documentation for internal functions as codebase grows
- Develop troubleshooting guides for common operational issues
- Create data model documentation for new developers

### Performance Monitoring
- Implement performance metrics collection for job monitoring
- Create alerting for failed jobs or performance degradation
- Plan for automated data quality monitoring

## Project Guidelines

### Task Management
- All new development work should be added to this TODO.md file first
- Break large features into manageable tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- Update task status regularly (üöß In Progress, ‚úÖ Completed, ‚ùå Blocked)
- Include estimated effort levels (Small, Medium, Large)

### Development Standards
- **MANDATORY**: All data processing scripts must implement standardized job logging
- **MANDATORY**: All data records must include job_id for data lineage tracking
- **Database**: Use test environment for validation before production runs
- **Job Logging**: Follow established `start_job_log()` and `update_job_log()` patterns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with job status tracking
- **Performance**: Consider index implications for new database columns
- **Documentation**: Update README.md and CLAUDE.md for significant changes

### Review Process
- Technical design review required for Medium and Large effort stories
- Data model changes require validation against existing data
- Performance impact assessment required for changes to core collection workflows
