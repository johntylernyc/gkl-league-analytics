# MLB Player Stats Pipeline Implementation

## Summary
- ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive MLB player statistics collection for ~750+ active players
- ðŸ”— Yahoo Fantasy player ID mapping with 79% coverage (1,583 players)
- ðŸ¤– Daily automated updates via GitHub Actions (3x daily)
- ðŸ’¾ Support for both SQLite and Cloudflare D1 databases

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Stats Collection
- Daily batting and pitching statistics for ALL MLB players (not just fantasy rosters)
- Real-time data from MLB Stats API via PyBaseball
- Historical backfill capability with parallel processing
- Resume support for interrupted bulk operations

### 2. Player ID Mapping System  
- Maps Yahoo Fantasy IDs to MLB/PyBaseball identifiers
- Fuzzy name matching with Jr./Sr. suffix handling
- 1,583 Yahoo player IDs successfully mapped (79% coverage)
- Confidence scoring for mapping quality

### 3. Automated Data Pipeline
- **backfill_stats.py**: Bulk historical data collection
- **update_stats.py**: Incremental daily updates  
- **data_quality_check.py**: Validation and health reporting
- Integrated with GitHub Actions for automatic 3x daily runs

### 4. Multi-Environment Support
- Test environment: Local SQLite database
- Production: Cloudflare D1 with direct API writes
- Environment-specific column name handling
- Proper foreign key dependency management

## Implementation Details

### New Modules Created
- `comprehensive_collector.py` - Core stats engine for all MLB players
- `yahoo_id_matcher.py` - Improved name matching with suffix handling
- `yahoo_player_search.py` - Yahoo Fantasy API integration
- `aggregate_rate_stats.py` - Calculate batting/pitching rate statistics
- `collect_real_stats.py` - PyBaseball/MLB API interface

### Database Schema Updates
- Added `player_mapping` table for Yahoo-MLB ID relationships
- Enhanced `daily_gkl_player_stats` with comprehensive columns
- Applied to both test and production databases
- Maintains backward compatibility

### GitHub Actions Integration
- âœ… Fixed: Player stats job was commented out, now enabled
- Runs at 6 AM, 1 PM, and 10 PM ET daily
- Includes pybaseball and pandas dependencies
- Direct D1 writes without intermediate SQLite step

## Testing Completed
- âœ… Local SQLite testing with full data pipeline
- âœ… Production D1 schema successfully applied
- âœ… Yahoo ID mapping populated and validated
- âœ… Data quality checks passing (Grade A - 96% health)
- âœ… Jr./Sr. suffix matching issues resolved

## Breaking Changes
None - All changes are additive and backward compatible

## Migration Notes
1. GitHub Actions will start collecting player stats after merge
2. First production run should be monitored for ~5-10 minutes
3. Recommend D1 backup before first automated run
4. Yahoo API tokens auto-refresh handled

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive release notes (v2.1.0)
- Added deployment review with lessons learned
- Updated implementation plans and PRDs
