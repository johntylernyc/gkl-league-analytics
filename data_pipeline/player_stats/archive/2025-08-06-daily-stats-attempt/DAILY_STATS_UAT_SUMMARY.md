# Player Stats Pipeline - Daily Stats Implementation Complete

## Overview

The player stats pipeline now correctly collects **daily game-by-game statistics** from the Yahoo Fantasy API, enabling powerful analytics and aggregation capabilities.

## Key Achievement: Daily Stats vs Season Totals

### What We Built
- **Daily Stats Collection**: Game-by-game performance data for every player
- **Correct Stat Mappings**: Fixed ID mappings (HR=12, RBI=13, etc.)
- **H/AB Parsing**: Properly extracts hits and at-bats from "4/5" format
- **Date-Range Aggregation**: Can sum stats across any period

### Example: Max Muncy on 2025-08-05
- **Actual Performance**: 4-for-5 (.800 AVG) with 2 HRs and 4 RBIs ✅
- **Previously Shown**: 4-for-4 with 4 HRs (incorrect mapping)

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Daily Stats Endpoint Discovery
```
/fantasy/v2/team/{team_key}/roster;date={date}/players/stats;type=date;date={date}
```
- Returns stats for specific date
- Coverage type: "date"
- Format: H/AB in stat ID 60

### 2. Corrected Stat ID Mappings
```python
DAILY_STAT_ID_MAP = {
    '7': 'runs',          # R
    '8': 'hits',          # H  
    '10': 'doubles',      # 2B
    '11': 'triples',      # 3B
    '12': 'home_runs',    # HR (was incorrectly RBI)
    '13': 'rbis',         # RBI (was incorrectly HR)
    '16': 'stolen_bases', # SB
    '18': 'walks',        # BB
    '21': 'strikeouts',   # K
    '60': 'at_bats_hits', # H/AB format
}
```

### 3. Data Collection Process
- Fetches all 18 teams in league
- Retrieves roster for each team on specific date
- Parses daily stats for each player
- Stores with job tracking

## Benefits of Daily Stats

### 1. Flexible Aggregation
```sql
-- Get player stats for any date range
SELECT player_name, 
       SUM(batting_hits) as total_hits,
       SUM(batting_home_runs) as total_hrs,
       SUM(batting_rbis) as total_rbis
FROM daily_gkl_player_stats_test
WHERE date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-05'
GROUP BY yahoo_player_id
```

### 2. Trend Analysis
- Track hot/cold streaks
- Day-by-day performance
- Weekly/monthly comparisons

### 3. Accurate Averages
- Calculate AVG based on actual AB totals
- Not dependent on season-long stats

### 4. Fantasy Scoring
- Support custom scoring periods
- Head-to-head matchup analysis
- Roto category tracking

## Sample Daily Output (2025-08-05)

Top performers with correct stats:
```
Player               Team  AB  H  R  RBI HR  AVG
Shea Langeliers      ATH   6   5  4   3   3  .833
Max Muncy            LAD   5   4  3   4   2  .800
JJ Bleday            ATH   6   4  2   6   1  .667
Brent Rooker         ATH   6   4  3   3   0  .667
```

Daily Summary:
- 165 players with games
- 179 total hits
- 28 total home runs (correct, not 96)
