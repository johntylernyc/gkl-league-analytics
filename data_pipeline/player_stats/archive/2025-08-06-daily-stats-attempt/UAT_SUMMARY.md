# Player Stats Pipeline - UAT Summary

## Overview
The player stats pipeline has been successfully updated and is ready for UAT validation. All critical schema issues have been resolved, and the test environment is fully functional.

## Test Environment Setup
- **Database**: `league_analytics_test.db`
- **Stats Table**: `daily_gkl_player_stats_test`
- **Mapping Table**: `player_id_mapping_test`
- **Test Data**: 8 days of sample MLB player stats (71 total records)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Schema Compatibility Fix
- Removed dependencies on non-existent columns (`content_hash`, `has_correction`)
- Updated `update_stats.py` to work with current schema
- Fixed environment-specific table name handling

### 2. Import Path Fixes
- Fixed circular imports in multiple modules
- Updated all imports to use `data_pipeline.player_stats.config`
- Added proper job tracking methods to `PlayerStatsJobManager`

### 3. Test Environment Support
- Proper database path selection based on environment
- Environment-specific table names (e.g., `daily_gkl_player_stats_test`)
- Test data population scripts with realistic MLB data

## UAT Test Results

### Job Tracking ✅
- Jobs are properly logged with unique IDs
- Status tracking works (pending → completed)
- Record counts are accurately tracked
- Both test population and incremental update jobs logged correctly

### Data Collection ✅
- Test data includes 10 sample MLB players
- Realistic batting statistics generated
- Proper date range handling (8 days of data)
- Player ID mappings established

### Incremental Updates ✅
- Stat correction window logic working (7-day window)
- Properly skips dates outside correction window
- Counts existing records correctly
- Job completion tracking functional

## UAT Validation Commands

1. **View test data summary**:
   ```bash
   cd data_pipeline/player_stats
   python validate_test_data_simple.py
   ```

2. **Run incremental update on test data**:
   ```bash
   python update_stats.py --environment test --days 7
   ```

3. **Check specific date**:
   ```bash
   python update_stats.py --environment test --date 2025-08-01
   ```

4. **View detailed validation**:
   ```bash
   python validate_test_data_simple.py --all
   ```

## Next Steps After UAT Approval

1. **Test with Production Data**:
   ```bash
   python update_stats.py --environment production --days 7
   ```

2. **Test D1 Integration**:
   ```bash
   python update_stats.py --use-d1 --days 3
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Actions Automation**:
   - Update `.github/workflows/data-refresh.yml`
   - Add player stats collection to scheduled runs

4. **Create PR for Merge**:
   - Merge `feature/player-stats-pipeline-improvements` to `main`
   - Update documentation

## Current Status
- ✅ Schema compatibility fixed
- ✅ Import issues resolved
- ✅ Test environment working
- ✅ Job tracking functional
- ✅ Incremental updates tested
- ⏳ Awaiting UAT approval
- ⏳ D1 integration testing pending
- ⏳ Production deployment pending

## Notes
- The `fetch_stats_from_mlb_api()` method is currently a placeholder
- In production, this will integrate with pybaseball for real MLB data
- Player ID mapping from Yahoo to MLB IDs will be required
- Stat corrections will be detected by comparing stored vs fresh data
