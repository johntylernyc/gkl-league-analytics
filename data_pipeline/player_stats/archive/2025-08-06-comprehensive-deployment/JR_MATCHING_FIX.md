# Jr. Suffix Matching Fix

**Issue**: Players with "Jr." in Yahoo weren't matching to MLB database
**Date Fixed**: August 6, 2025

## Problem Description

Yahoo Fantasy keeps suffixes like "Jr.", "Sr.", "III" in player names:
- Yahoo: "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."
- MLB/Chadwick: "Vladimir Guerrero"

Our original normalization removed suffixes from both names, but the fuzzy matching score was too low because of the length difference before normalization.

## Solution Implemented

Updated `fuzzy_match_name()` in `yahoo_id_matcher.py` to:
1. Detect if one name has a suffix and the other doesn't
2. If so, normalize both and check for exact match
3. Return perfect score (1.0) if names match after suffix removal

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- Names with Jr. were getting low match scores (~0.74)
- Falling below 0.85 threshold
- Players like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. weren't matching

### After Fix
```
Vladimir Guerrero Jr. vs Vladimir Guerrero: 1.000 ✓
Bobby Witt Jr. vs Bobby Witt: 1.000 ✓
Ronald Acuña Jr. vs Ronald Acuna: 0.917 ✓
```

## Verified Matches

| MLB Name | Yahoo Name | Yahoo ID | Status |
|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| Vladimir Guerrero | Vladimir Guerrero Jr. | 10621 | ✓ Matched |
| Bobby Witt | Bobby Witt Jr. | 11771 | ✓ Matched |
| Luis Robert | Luis Robert Jr. | 10765 | ✓ Matched |
| Fernando Tatis | Fernando Tatis Jr. | 10977 | ✓ Matched |
| Ronald Acuna | Ronald Acuña Jr. | 10593 | ✓ Matched |

## Impact

This fix ensures that all players with generational suffixes (Jr., Sr., III, etc.) are correctly matched between Yahoo and MLB databases, improving our overall Yahoo ID coverage.

## Code Changes

```python
# Now handles suffix differences explicitly
if name1_has_jr != name2_has_jr:
    norm1 = self.normalize_name(name1)
    norm2 = self.normalize_name(name2)
    if norm1 == norm2:
        return 1.0  # Perfect match
```

This is a significant improvement as many star players have Jr. in their names!
